# sulfidesaturation
A repository for codes related to the paper Nathwani et al. "High magmatic oxidation state delays sulfide saturation and promotes metal fluxing in the deep crust".

This repository includes:
1) Isobaric equilbirium crystallisation models for primitive arc magma compositions at variable fO2 using MAGEMin
2) Model which integrates MAGEMin generated liquid lines of descents with models of sulfide saturation and sulfur speciation
3) Script used to fit XANES spectra of the S K-edge in apatite
